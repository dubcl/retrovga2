It's self-powered from the VGA cable and you are free to play with the 4 switches at your will without being afraid of getting things fried!

The four switches in the board are:
ON/OFF: Turns the scanlines effect ON/OFF
EVEN/ODD: Tells the board to draw only ODD or EVEN scanlines
WIDTH: Tells the board to draw double (thicker) or single scanlines
VSYNC: Inverts VSYNC signal. Need to change it when you're using a VGA resolution different than 640x480@60Hz or 1024x768@60Hz, otherwise scanlines won't work.
